                            <br>
                            <p>
                                Ever since I was young, I enjoyed playing video games and because of that I decided 
                                to learn about what makes video games run. I then became interested in computers and programming. 
                                My interest in computers and programming led me to pursue an education in computer engineering at the University of Toronto.

                            <p>At the moment I’m in my third year and taking the following courses:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Applied Fundamentals of Machine Learning</li>
                                <li>Computer Networks I</li>

                            </ul>
                            <p>My hobbies include reading manga, watching anime, sleeping, and playing video games.</p>
